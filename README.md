# Python-PDF-Splitter
I made this script for a friend of mine who was scanning documents for his job. He had to scan a bunch, but he had to scan 2 and then save them to a file and so on. This allowed him to put all in the feeder and then split them into files
by just providing their names.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.12
- Pip
# Setup

pip install -r requirements.txt
